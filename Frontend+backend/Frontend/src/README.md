**THIS IS THE FRONTEND CODE OF THE IITK MAIL CLIENT RECRUITMENT QUESTION
To be clear in the very beginning, i would like to tell you that i have referred to tailwind css website
for help in designing buttons and inputboxes, few of the divs i have taken from website itself(not many).
1.I have created different components initially and then imported them in my App.jsx file.
2.I have my quantum phy quiz on 4/4/2024 , so pardon me because i can only manage to come up with this in the amount of time i can take out.
3.I have taken a few icons from heroicons(the code of that attachment icon).
4.And those political jokes ...ahh I couldn't think of coming up with anything else.
5.I CREATED THE REACT FILE BY npm create vite@latest.
6.I then  installed all the dependencies.
7.And i will also try to submit the backend part , but their is some pblm with my mongodb instance
  so please if you want to check my backend just try to run it with your db.
