**IT CONTAINS THE FRONTEND AND THE BACKEND CODE OF THE IITK MAIL CLIENT RECRUITMENT QUESTION .
To be clear in the very beginning, i would like to tell you that i have referred to tailwind css website
for help in designing buttons and inputboxes, few of the divs i have taken from website itself(not many).
1.I have created different components initially and then imported them in my App.jsx file.
2.And those political jokes ...ahh I couldn't think of coming up with anything else.
3.I CREATED THE REACT FILE BY npm create vite@latest.
4.I have taken a few icons from heroicons(the code of that attachment icon).
5.I then  installed all the dependencies.
6.And i will also try to submit the backend part , but their is some pblm with my mongodb instance
  so please if you want to check my backend just try to run it with your db.
  
1.I have worked on backend code by slightly changing the frontend code.
2.I have also added a signup page in code, which is not present in the independent frontend file so 
that i can explain the authentification easily.
3.I have used mongodb (unfortunately, it always goes down).
4.Authentication logic is contained in the middleware file.
5.I have used the jsonwebtoken library for auth purposes.
6.I need to admit that i have loosely coded backend (since I don't have much knowledge in it).
7.Lot of other libraries could be seen in work (express, cors, axios, etc).
